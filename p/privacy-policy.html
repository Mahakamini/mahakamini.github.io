    <h2>Android Permissions Used</h2>
    <p>This app requests the following permissions as declared in <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" /&gt;</code></li>
      <li><code>&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" /&gt;</code></li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">
      <strong>Note:</strong> On newer versions of Android (10/11+), external storage access is limited by Scoped Storage.
      The app only accesses user-approved files and complies with Google Play's data access policies.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why We Request Storage Permission</h2>
    <p>
      The storage permissions are used solely for the following purposes (adjust if needed):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>To allow users to import or open files stored on their device (e.g., documents, images, or backups).</li>
      <li>To save files created by the app into a folder accessible to the user (e.g., export, backup, or download results).</li>
      <li>To perform backup and restore functions explicitly requested by the user.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Access occurs only after the user grants permission and only for files necessary to perform these functions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data Collected</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>No personal data is automatically collected</strong> by this app.
      Any files or information used by the app remain stored locally on your device unless you explicitly choose to share them.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data stored locally:</strong> Files that you create, edit, or import using the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Data not collected:</strong> We do not collect your name, email, phone number, location, or any personal identifiers for analytics or advertising purposes.</li>

    <h2>Crash Reports and Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      This app does <strong>not</strong> include any analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.
      If a crash reporting service is added in the future, it will only collect anonymous technical data necessary to fix app issues, never personal information.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
    <p>
      All data and files you choose to create or import remain under your control and are only used to provide app functionality.

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
      The app stores files locally on your device. We implement reasonable measures to protect your data,
      but since no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Third-Party Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>This app <strong>does not share any user data</strong> with third parties for advertising, analytics, or marketing purposes. Data may be shared only if:</p>
