    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 08 Okt 2025</p>
    <p>This application was developed by <a href="/">MahakaMini</a>. This Privacy Policy explains how the app handles permissions and data on your device.</p>
    <h3>1. Permissions Used</h3>
    <p>The app requires the following permissions:</p>
    <p>
      <b>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</b> â€” used to read files from your device storage (such as images, documents, or media required by the app).<br>
      <b>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</b> â€” used to save processed files or generated content to your device storage.<br>
      These permissions are used only locally on your device. No data is sent to or stored on any server.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2. Data Collection</h3>
    <p>
      The app does not collect, store, or share any personal information.<br>
      All operations are performed offline and do not involve any internet connection for analytics, tracking, or data gathering.
    </p>
    
    <h3>3. Ads and Analytics</h3>
    <p>
      The app does not display ads and does not use any third-party analytics services such as Google Analytics or Firebase.
    </p>
    
    <h3>4. Data Security</h3>
    <p>
      Since no user data is collected or transmitted, there is no risk of data leakage through third parties. All activity happens locally on the userâ€™s device.
    </p>
    
    <h3>5. Changes to This Policy</h3>
